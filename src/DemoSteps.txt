* Write a WinForms Demo that hangs!


--- Step 1 ---

* Native Windows App, describing the concept of a Windows Program.
* Pointing out the MessageLoop
* What happens if the messageloop gets blocked?

--- Step 3 ---
* Showing the UwpApp and explain, how it works in principle.
* Demo the first WebAPI Call.

* How to fix this problem:
	--> Go back to the WinForms App, and demonstrate that there is no task to await,
            and what consequences that has.

--- Step 4: Therotical. Talk about I/O Bound, CPU Bound and why LIEBRARIES should not LIE! ---
